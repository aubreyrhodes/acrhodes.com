title: Getting Over Yourself

The evidence is starting to pile up. I don't think that I can actually do everything in the world on my own.

I've always been the do it yourself type. In my life as a software developer, I've had to to tone down this instinct down in order for me to be successful. Because I am able to rely on the open source community and my incredibly smart co-workers, I can lean on resources external to myself to not waste my time solving a problem that has already been taken care of. In software, this overly independent mindset is sometimes referred to as [Not Invented Here Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here).

I'm starting to find that I am falling in to the 'not invented here' trap in other parts of my life as well. Socially, I tend to make plans and then invite people along instead of coming up with plans. At home, I do all of my own yard work and home repairs. Even this blog, until very recently, has been completely a solo act. 'Do it by yourself' has been my de facto motto until recently.

More and more, however, I'm starting to realize the immense value of collaboration. Not only do you get insights that come from outside or your own experience, but your work becomes decoupled from your own identity and can take on a life of its own. The act of bouncing ideas back and forth helps an idea evolve into something completely different.

To try and force myself to be less independent with my writing, I'm going to start to look for collaborators to help me author some posts for this blog. In software development the act of [pair programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) has become increasingly embraced and I would love to try the practice for writing as well.

So, if you have an idea for a blog post on software development or collaboration or would like to pair on a blog post, hit up [@aubRho](https://twitter.com/aubrho) on twitter. I'd love to try it out.
