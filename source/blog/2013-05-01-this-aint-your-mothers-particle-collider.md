So, I hate this. In general, I'm a pretty laid back person, but this drives me up the wall. You're grandfathers did not have feuds about using a relational database over a NoSQL solution. Every Christmas, your family doesn't cosy and a fire and write webapps using an MVC framework because that's what you've done since you were two. These situations don't make any sense, but developers still talk about best practices as 'traditions'.

A tradition is a habit. An act that is repeated time after time because you enjoy the ceremony of it. You like drinking a beer with your same friend every thursday night or enjoy sacrificing the same type of goat every year when the harvest comes in. However, this is not (or absolutely should not be) the reason best practices in software exist.

Best practices are a convention, they are followed because they are generally thought to be the most effective. Importantly, they can also be changed without any emotional cost. When a technology comes along and proves to be better, you shouldn't pine for the good old days where you used to use a worse solution.

So, it bugs me when someone says "We're switching from a traditional MySQL database to PosgreSQL", because it's not a tradition they are changing. You can argue that I'm being a curmudgeon, but words are important. They shape the way we think. If we describe the practices we adhere to in an emotional manner, then when it's time revaluate them we will never be able to be biased.

Or maybe I'm just a stick in the mud.
