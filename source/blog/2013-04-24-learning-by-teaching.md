title: Learning By Teaching
---

I very rarely know what I'm doing. While this could be because with a body like mine you don't get the whole brain as well, I think it's more a statement about getting to learn on the job. Since I can either [automate](/blog/2013/01/13/a-week-of-automation.html) or become more efficient at tasks that I've completed in the past, I get to spend most of my time working on something that I never have before. For me, one of the ways I learn best is to teach someone else how to do what I'm doing.

For me, this comes out a lot when I'm working with a new technology. It is easy enough to just touch the surface and learn enough to complete the task at hand. However, when I want to dive deep into the inner workings of a new library or methodology nothing beats putting together a blog post or short talk. I am not exactly sure if it is the peer pressure presented when you put your self forward as a sort of authority or the act sitting and thinking through what you are trying to communicate, but you become much more confident in your knowledge of the source material.

This has been on my mind lately because I want to learn more about how authors and editors communicate when working on articles and books with a goal of learning enough about the process to eventually build a product to make that type of collaboration easier. To that end, the focus of many of my upcoming posts to this blog will be about how to better collaborate on the written word. Hopefully, I'll have completed enough research so that I don't sound like a total jackass.
