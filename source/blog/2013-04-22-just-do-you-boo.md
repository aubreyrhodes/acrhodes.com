title: Just Do You Boo
---

I have come to a decision. I do not want to be an idea. Over the last few years as a software developer, I have noticed a push from the community to have individuals promote themselves through blogging, side projects and social media. While I find these endeavors worthwhile, I also find that they lead one to attempting to develop a personal brand. Branding can be great for organizations but for individuals they turn into a prison cell that was built by the inmate.

Recently, I attended the final [LessConf](http://lessconf.lesseverything.com/) and one of the talks I attended was by [Jack Passion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Passion). Jack's talk was on building a personal brand, something he is very qualified to talk about. He has his own publishing company, reality tv show, and several endorsements. A large portion of the talk concerned building packaging around yourself. That is to say the material you put out into the world that constitutes your brand.

By it's very nature, your packaging distorts who you are to make it easier for more people to consume whatever it is you are doing. More often than not, this distortion comes in the form of distilling who you are down into one or two very simple concepts. In addition, this packaging is very static. Once people recognize the box you have built for yourself, it very difficult to evolve.

I spoke to Jack after his talk and asked him, now that his brand is well established, if he found that it limited him in any way. His response was "absolutely". His use of his profound beard as his packaging means that it is harder now for him to grow his live as a musician. No longer is he a person. He is beard man.

I cannot argue that Jack would be known to more people if he did not build his brand around his beard, but it seems like he may have been more free. While I do want to start to build a community around the work that I am doing, I have decided that I want the packaging that I encase myself in should be as thin and transparent as possible. Instead of being simple, I'll just be my weird self. Weird real loud.
